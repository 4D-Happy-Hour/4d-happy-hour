# Running a web page on a local server (2025-08-23 00:38Z)

I want to run this web page in a server I can access from another computer on this network'

To run your web page on a local server accessible from other computers on your network, you can use a simple static file server like Python's built-in HTTP server or Node.js's `http-server`. Here are two easy options:

### Option 1: Python HTTP Server
If you have Python installed, run this command in your project directory:
```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 0.0.0.0
```
- This starts a server on port 8000, accessible from other devices using your computer's IP address.

### Option 2: Node.js http-server
If you have Node.js installed, you can use the `http-server` package:
```sh
npm install -g http-server
http-server -p 8000 -a 0.0.0.0
```
- This also serves your files on port 8000.

After starting the server, find your computer's local IP address (e.g., `192.168.x.x`) and access the site from another device at `http://<your-ip>:8000`.

Would you like me to run one of these commands for you? If so, which option do you prefer?

I'm using the first option. Does the server update the web page as I make changes?

The Python HTTP server does not automatically reload or update the web page when you make changes. However, if you refresh the page in your browser, you will see the latest version of your files.

If you want automatic browser refresh when files change, you can use a tool like `live-server` (Node.js) instead. Would you like instructions or setup for live reloading?
